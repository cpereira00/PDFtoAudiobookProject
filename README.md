## PDFtoAudiobook Project

This project takes advantage of the python-text-to-speech library and the PDF file reader to allow users to input any pdf file to be read. Users can choose to either read a specific page or the entire PDF and now the ability to read a range of pages. 

The idea to create an automation program as such comes from the scientific data which supports the idea that we retain more information if we are reading while simultaneously listening to the same material. The program works best with PDFs that have a simple format such as the tester document included (which is a proposal I wrote for a technical writing class).
